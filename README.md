# Google Play Store Case Study
This case study is the GooglePlaystore Case study to analyze the Target Variable and perform different analysis using EDA.
In this case study, the following key steps and observations were made:

1. **Data Handling and Cleaning**:
   - The dataset underwent data cleaning, which included removing junk records, addressing missing values, modifying data types, and eliminating outliers.

2. **Rating Analysis**:
   - A histogram was used to visualize the distribution of ratings, which revealed a skew towards higher ratings.

3. **App Categories**:
   - A bar chart was employed to analyze app categories, showing that the majority of apps belong to the "Everyone" category.

4. **Rating-Size Relationship**:
   - A scatter plot was used to explore the relationship between app size and ratings. A weak trend between the two variables was observed. Regression plots were briefly examined for further insights.

5. **Pair-Plot Analysis**:
   - A pair plot was created to visualize multiple scatter plots and draw various inferences. Notable observations included a weak trend between price and rating and an inverse relationship between reviews and price.

6. **Content Rating Categories**:
   - Estimator functions, bar plots, and box plots were employed to examine the spread of ratings across different content rating categories. The primary finding was that the "Everyone" category had numerous apps with very low ratings.

7. **Heat Map**:
   - A heat map was generated to compare ratings across various reviews and content rating buckets, providing a comprehensive visual representation of the data.

In summary, the case study involved data preparation, exploratory data analysis, and visualization techniques to gain insights into app ratings, categories, relationships between variables, and content rating distributions. The analysis revealed important trends and patterns in the dataset.
